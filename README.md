# ModuloNCounter

The code in the repository builds the following points upon the requirements from the Modulo Counter document available in the repository.

Implement the classes ModuloNDigit and ModuloNCounter that provide the same functionality as the
structs and their associated functions from the Modulo Counter Document. 

Define constructors and destructors as substitutes of the functions with the corresponding purpose.

Additionally, provide the functionality to increment the values of instances of the two counter types by overloading the prefix and postfix increment operators, thus making it possible to write counter++ and ++counter (Observe the proper semantics of the two operators).

UML class diagrams and documentation.
